    To start off the month, we can officially announce the number that the MLYU is. 
    This comes in to credit writer, ShinGetterWolf1, who thought go the number. 
    Thinking about the number was definitely important and it needed to be significant.
  </p>    

  <blockquote>
    “The universe number for the MLYU is Earth-500. Since we’re beginning this new Marvel 
    universe at 500 subscribers on The Idea Maker YouTube channel, we want it to have 
    meaning and a place within the Marvel universe as its own fan universe. Thanks to 
    ShinGetterWolf1, it definitely feels like another brick has been placed in the bigger 
    universe, pun intended, to be the first building bricks to the next step in this vast 
    universe.”
