    Today in Orlando, Florida, Destination D23 was held for fans to see the 
    upcoming projects Disney has in store with their motion pictures divisions 
    such as Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation, Pixar, Marvel Studios, 
    and Lucasfilm. But we also hear that Idea Films has a few brief announcements 
    of their own in regards to the MLYU aka The Marvel LEGO YouTube Universe.
  </p>    

  <blockquote>
    “Today, we are excited to announce the start of production to our first fan
    brickflim, LEGO X-Men, and we are excited to bring our vision of what the X-
    Men is, what it stands for, and how they haven’t had the spotlight for a while
    and we believe that even though that this phase’s road is leading to another
    hero, we wanted to start with them to be the anchor of this upcoming universe, 	
    while also sprinkling them in other solo/team projects while also giving other
    heroes and hero teams their times to shine.”

  <p>
    While The Idea Maker didn’t want to go into detail about the upcoming projects, 
    he did reveal that Phase 1 of the MLYU will consist of 8 fan brick films with 
    the upcoming LEGO stop motion fan brickfilm, LEGO X-Men, will be the beginning 
    of this brand new universe. The timeline consists of these films so far:
  </p>  

  <ul>
    <li>The teaser trailer and title reveal will be released at 425 subscribers.</li>
    <li>The official trailer will be released at 450 subscribers.</li>
    <li>The official clip will be released at 475 subscribers.</li>  
    <li>LEGO X-Men will be released at 500 subscribers.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    As for the next upcoming entries in Phase 1 of the Marvel LEGO YouTube Universe, 
    it’ll go as follows:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The second untitled MLYU movie will be released at 550 subscribers.
    <li>The third untitled MLYU movie will be released 600 subscribers.</li>
    <li>The fourth untitled MLYU movie will be released at 700 subscribers.</li>
    <li>The fifth untitled MLYU movie will be released at 750 subscribers.</li>
    <li>The sixth untitled MLYU movie will be released at 800 subscribers.</li>
    <li>The seventh untitled MLYU movie will be released at 850 subscribers.</li>
    <li>The eight untitled MLYU movie will be released at 1,000 subscribers.</li>     
  </ul>

  <p>
    Once the teaser trailer releases, there will be an idea of what the next movie will 
    be, but it’ll be very vague. But we can happily report that The Idea Maker has a few 
    details to share on the upcoming projects.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    “The second project will be focused on multiple versions of one character against 
    a villain, but they’re gonna need some help from a team that hasn’t been really 
    established in the current MCU. A few games, comics, and movies, yes, but this 
    team will be redefined in a different way, but the purpose is the same. The third 
    will piggyback off of the second one and will venture into the fourth, sixth, and 
    eighth entries. The fifth entry will take a pretty big turn into another corner of 
    the MLYU and the seventh entry will be more ground focused but in a grander scale. 
    These steps will go have post credit scenes that’ll tease the next projects, but mid 
    credit scenes that will go into the bigger problem that’ll be a MAJOR aspect into 
    the universe.”.

    More details will come later, but we will see if anyone has any questions about this 
    universe and about any character appearances that will make an impact or if we’ll see 
    any classic team ups or any new team ups that we haven’t seen in a while or at all in 
    any type of Marvel comic, series, and movie. More announcements will be made later down 
    the road as well as any additional casting, crew, and entries that have been established. 
    Currently, The Idea Maker is at 419 subscribers and is working on the teaser trailer/title 
    reveal, while filming the first installment.
