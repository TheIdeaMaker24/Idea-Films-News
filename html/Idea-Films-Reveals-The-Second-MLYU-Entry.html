  <h4>September 5, 2025</h4>
  <p>
    Today, we unveil the next entry after LEGO X-Men: The Uncanny Beginning. Say hello to the next entry 
    in the LEGO Marvel YouTube Universe. 
  </p>    

  <blockquote>
    “For the next entry in the MLYU, we will be focusing on another hero that helped shape the Marvel universe, 
    but in this, we will also be introducing a superhero team that has been reincarnated multiple times, but 
    we will be having this particular team be teaming up with Spider-Man. Oh and this is also a dual Spider-Man 
    story. This is a Peter Parker AND Miles Morales story!”
