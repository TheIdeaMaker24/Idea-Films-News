  <h4>September 8, 2025</h4>
  <p>
    Today, we unveil that the third entry in the MLYU is being written now that LEGO Spider-Man: Vampire: Hunt 
    has its script officially written and completed. 
  </p>    

  <blockquote>
    “The third entry in the MLYU is going to be a quicker paced movie, as we dive into something that will start 
    showing a recurring theme that will not only go over the course of the first phase of the MLYU, but will also 
    branch into the whole first saga that will take about 3-5 phases to full tell. This is unless there are projects 
    that fans wants to see, then we can adjust the story to fit what the audience wants!”
