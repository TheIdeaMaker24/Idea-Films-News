    As the verge of 500 subscribers comes closer, anime vTuber and 
    reaction YouTuber, The Idea Maker, begins a new journey into stop 
    motion animation and into the Marvel universe. While many have been 
    critical of the current state of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, The 
    Idea Maker has taken it upon himself to take things to a new creative
    level and bring a new definition to “building a new Marvel universe”. 
    The Idea Maker established Idea Films, his own movie studio within the 
    channel to bring some exciting LEGO projects and any film or series project 
    to pursue a new side of being a vTuber and content creator to share joy 
    and inspiration to others while integrating his faith into the mix of his 
    videos. With this, a new cast and new story will be unveiled to the world 
    through YouTube and will redefine and rewrite the rules as to who can appear 
    in these new sets of fan brick films.

  <blockquote>
    “I originally wanted to make a special 500 subscriber special and thought 		
    about making a stop motion video with the LEGO X-Mansion set to celebrate 		
    the first video I made for the channel back in April 2024, which was a reaction 	
    video for Season 1 Episode 1 of Marvel Animation’s X-Men ’97. But then, I 			
    thought, ”What if I could make story to celebrate who the X-Men are and what 	
    they stand for?”. So I just started formulating ideas and got inspired by the 		
    movies and TV shows that are out there and put so much love and care into the 	
    story to make sure it stays true to the Marvel environment, characters, and 		
    universe.”

    “I know there’s so many projects I have to edit and film, but I also needed to focus on my 
    relationship with God, family, personal matters, my health, and moving forward to honor my 
    grandmother’s passing a little over a year ago as she was the inspiration to why I became a 
    vTuber and a LEGO stop motion artist. There’s been tributes to her in every video made and 
    released after her passing and that will never stop. But with God’s, my family’s, my friends’
    , and my subscribers and YouTube community’s love, help, and support, I know I can 	accomplish 
    these ambitious goals”.

    The Idea Maker has been applying his faith and engineering major into his videos as he’s been 
    on a journey to find the balanced path needed to continue this bright future ahead of him and 
    won’t stop here. As this article will also reveal, he’s also planning a special phase of films 
    to make a new story arc to lead to a major villain where multiple superhero teams will team up 
    to save the universe.
  </p>

  <p>
    The future at Idea Films is bright as this new cinematic universe takes the vision Kevin Feige, 
    President of Marvel Studios, has envisioned for the well established Marvel Cinematic Universe 
    and the approach that James Gunn, co-CEO and director  and creator to different Marvel Studios’ 
    and DC projects like the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy and holiday special, this year’s Superman, 
    Peacemaker, Creature Commandos, and The Suicide Squad from 2021, has taken with taking time on a 
    scripted go forward when the story feels right and wanting to make a new universe where others 
    feel excited to see a new story and buildup as we will see various superheroes ands superhero 
    teams that will make you anticipated for what’s next. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The Idea Maker has the stories for the other projects in this Phase 1 slate of superhero fan brick 
    films and will reveal on a later date. After the title reveal/teaser trailer gets announced and posted 
    on YouTube, there will be a reveal of how many projects will be in Phase 1 of the Marvel LEGO Marvel 
    YouTube Universe (or MLYU). No official titles will be revealed and characters will be revealed in 
    casting announcements and this will be left up to viewers on what the story will be about and what this 
    big story will lead to. No plot for the upcoming LEGO X-Men fan brick film has been disclosed yet and 
    will not give an official synopsis until the teaser trailer/title reveal is released. A possible teaser 
    poster might be uploaded at that time, but that is uncertain news. At this time, we just have to wait 
    and see what kind of story will be cooking for the MLYU and at the time of The Idea Maker being at 419 
    subscribers, we will have to wait and see when the next milestone will hit.
