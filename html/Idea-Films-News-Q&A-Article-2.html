    With these past articles, there has been many new impressions over at Idea Films News and 
    The Idea Maker’s YouTube channel and another question came in to be answered. This question 
    from friend and YouTuber, Ezra Carr376 who asks:
  </p>    

  <blockquote>
    Ezra Carr376: How many characters will you include in each movie?
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    The Idea Maker: That’s a great question! It depends on the story and how it can tie into 
    the main story and what and how the plots can build on top of each other without having 
    some sort of discrepancy or plot hole. At the moment, for X-Men: The Uncanny Beginning, 
    we have 17 characters. The next one we have for Spider-Man: Vampire Hunt has 16 characters. 
    Our last one in Phase 1 has approximately 53-55 characters and POSSIBLY counting, but we’ll 
    see where we can take things to wrap up Phase 1. 
  </blockquote>

    Even though there was only one question so far, this is a great step towards more Q&A sessions 
    in the future. As a reminder, the timeline consists of these films so far:

    More details will come later, but we will see when the next Q&A article will be, 
    but I believe that we can have this once a week so that way we can have more questions 
    for the upcoming Q&A article. Currently, The Idea Maker is at 428 subscribers and is 
    working on the teaser trailer/title reveal, while filming the first installment.
