  <h4>October 13, 2025</h4>
  <p>
    Today, we have just hit 450 subscribers and we couldn’t be more grateful for your guys’ 
    love and support. This news article is long overdue and us here at Idea Films understand 
    that the MLYU news is very important to all of you. For this, we have MANY new exciting 
    developments to bring to you for this and future issues! We first unveil that the next 
    entry, which is still to be titled, is still currently being written and is being prepped 
    while the first phase of the MLYU is currently being shaped to tell the stories that we 
    want to tell for the MLYU.
  </p>    

  <blockquote>
 	  “We want to make sure that the MLYU starts off with a solid beginning and these stories 
    that follow are something that not only that fans will be surprised about, but also will 
    not know that they even needed those stories to be told. We want to make sure that all of 
    these entries have some sort of place in their hearts and resonate with them, whether it’s 
    the characters or the story or even the structure of a major story that’s being written as 
    we speak.”

    We would also like to mention that we stated before that at 450 subscribers that the official 
    trailer for LEGO X-Men: The Uncanny Beginning would be released at this time, but unfortunately, 
    due to some circumstances in the Halloween movie marathon this year, we have to postpone the 
    trailer for the 475 subscriber milestone. Filming has resumed again with X-Men and we are back 
    getting more and more excited to see this project come to life. If there are any more postponements 
    due to the Halloween Movie Marathon and the upcoming Christmas Movie Marathon, then the trailer will 
    be at 490 subscribers.

  <blockquote>
	  “We are super happy that the whole cast for LEGO Spider-Man: Vampire Hunt has been casted as well 
    as our mid credits and post credits scenes characters have been casted too but they will be revealed 
    at the time of release! Plus we also might have our final casting for Storm for LEGO X-Men: The Uncanny 
    Beginning soon, but we’re going over the details with her and hoping to finalize the casting. It’s a 
    very exciting time for us here, plus the universe is about to expand soon!”

  <blockquote>
    “We will now release 11 entries in Phase 1 as we feel like there’s several projects that would make more of an 
    important story that will solidify the importance of these characters when it reaches to the finale of Phase 1. 
    This is something majorly important in order to not feel like there’s any plot holes or gaps plus stories you wouldn’t 
    expect to either have adapted or spoofed or created originally. But it’s all done in great love and respect to Marvel, 
    their comics, their movies, and their characters”.

    This is the confirmed cast so far. Casting and writing for the future installments are currently being worked on and 
    underway. The script for the third entry is currently being written as there’s a major importance to the story to make 
    sure it’s polished to bring out the next parts of the story and bring new sides of the MLYU that will make you wonder 
    where is this story leading to. More details will come later, but we will see when the next casting and crew announcements 
    will occur. Currently, The Idea Maker is at 450 subscribers and the official trailer is coming soon at 475 subscribers, 
    while filming the first installment.
