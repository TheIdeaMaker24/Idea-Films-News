    With these past two articles, there has been a few questions that have been 
    risen and over at Idea Films News and The Idea Maker’s YouTube channel, we 
    have decided to have several articles throughout the run that helps answer 
    any questions and even address any theories, rumors, and comments that will 
    appear here and we’ll be looking over fans’ questions, comments, concerns, 
    theories, and more!! We start off with several questions from friend and 
    YouTuber, Ezra Carr376 who asks first:
  </p>    

  <blockquote>
    Ezra Carr376: How long will your LEGO X-Men movie run for?
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    The Idea Maker: That’s a great question. Since there’s so much story in this
    script and the actor script is 64 pages long, I don’t wanna assume a short 		
    runtime, but maybe around somewhere between 30-50 minutes. Usually the voice 
    actors would provide their voices first and then we’ll film it, but because 		
    of the close deadline, it’ll have to be filming first for my scenes that I voice 		
    certain characters and have voiceovers for and then I can determine how long 	
    the video will be. This is also including the editing, visual effects, and any 		
    issues that can occur or need a reshoot but we’re hoping for a smooth 			
    production.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    Ezra Carr376: How many phases will this new Marvel LEGO Universe be?
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    The Idea Maker: For that question, I’m not entirely sure about that, because 		
    there’s so many villains and so many characters and stories that can be 			
    written. I think for now, this saga, which is currently untitled, is gonna be 
    around 3-5 phases since there’s a huge villain I have in mind but I want the 
    build up to also have individual stories that build on other heroes and team ups. 
    I want it to 	truly feel like a Marvel universe of so many amazing opportunities 
    so the story will keep progressing as it goes. 
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Even though there are a few questions so far, this is a great step towards more Q&A 
    sessions in the future. As a reminder, the timeline consists of these films so far:
  </p>  

  <ul>
    <li>The teaser trailer and title reveal will be released at 425 subscribers.</li>
    <li>The official trailer will be released at 450 subscribers.</li>
    <li>The official clip will be released at 475 subscribers.</li>  
    <li>LEGO X-Men will be released at 500 subscribers.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    As for the next upcoming entries in Phase 1 of the Marvel LEGO YouTube Universe, 
    it’ll go as follows:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The second untitled MLYU movie will be released at 550 subscribers.
    <li>The third untitled MLYU movie will be released 600 subscribers.</li>
    <li>The fourth untitled MLYU movie will be released at 700 subscribers.</li>
    <li>The fifth untitled MLYU movie will be released at 750 subscribers.</li>
    <li>The sixth untitled MLYU movie will be released at 800 subscribers.</li>
    <li>The seventh untitled MLYU movie will be released at 850 subscribers.</li>
    <li>The eight untitled MLYU movie will be released at 1,000 subscribers.</li>     
  </ul>

  <p>
    Once the teaser trailer releases, there will be an idea of what the next movie will 
    be, but it’ll be very vague. But we can happily report that The Idea Maker has a few 
    details to share on the upcoming projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    More details will come later, but we will see when the next Q&A article will be, 
    but I believe that we can have this once a week so that way we can have more questions 
    for the upcoming Q&A article. Currently, The Idea Maker is at 419 subscribers and is 
    working on the teaser trailer/title reveal, while filming the first installment.
