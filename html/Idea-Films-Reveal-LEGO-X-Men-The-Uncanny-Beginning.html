    the journey into the bigger universe. When unknown mutant DNA signatures get detected 
    by a malfunctioning Cerebro, the X-Men will be split to rebuild their home and tear 
    down what Magneto has planned for the X-Men while finding out that this connects to 
    the bigger picture that will take more than the X-Men to figure out.”
