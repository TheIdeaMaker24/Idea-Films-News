  <h4>November 8, 2025</h4>
  <p>
    Today, we unveil the next entry after LEGO Spider-Man: Vampire Hunt. Say hello to the third entry in the 
    LEGO Marvel YouTube Universe. 
  </p>    

  <blockquote>
	  “For the third entry in the MLYU, we will be focusing on the next chapter in the major story that will be 
    shaping what is going on in this Marvel universe, who the big bad might be, and maybe many teases to where 
    this story is heading. But there is a major story that is going to be shaping and taking over this story. 
    The MLYU is going towards a story that maybe you might know where it’s going, but it’ll be done in a way 
    where you might never have thought of before! This story goes beyond the standard solo team movie, because 
    it’s a team up movie. It focuses on another group, but will team up with the main group and you’ll be amazed 
    at how this could be somewhat of a future collaborative team that’ll be around for a while.”

    As we mentioned before, the X-Men will be scattered around Phase 1 of the MLYU and in this story, we have one 
    X-Men involved. To get those interested in the third entry, we will unveil the title and characters involved 
    in this third entry. We call the third entry, LEGO The Fantastic Four: Galactic Pathways.

    <li>CryoArchonEspy75 - Gwen Stacy/Spider Woman</li>
    <li>KiiD KAii - Miles Morales/Spider-Man</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is the confirmed cast and the mid credits and post credits characters have also been casted! This is 
    a great start as our casts have been getting more and more solidified the more that we write, talk, film, 
    and formulate the stories and ideas. At the moment, the initial draft is complete and is undergoing proofreading, 
    continuity checks, and story structure checks before the next entry will be written. There is talk of a possible 
    slate reveal of where this story is going to go, in which we want to have some sort of a base direction on where 
    this is going, but at the last minute, you won’t expect this to go the way you’re thinking. This plot in the MLYU 
    will be the beginning of where there will be multiple groups and heroes will team up and you’ll see this a lot 
    more often, especially when we dive more into future appearances of other Avengers and Marvel characters throughout 
    the MLYU. The Fantastic Four teaming up with the Spider Trio and Jean Grey is very exciting and the finale of this 
    movie will leave you wondering about what this overall story will be. More details will come later within the week, 
    but we will see when the next announcements will occur. Currently, The Idea Maker is at 464 subscribers and the 
    official trailer for LEGO X-Men: The Uncanny Beginning is coming soon at 475 subscribers, while filming the first 
    installment is underway, filming for LEGO Spider-Man: Vampire Hunt will be commencing immediately right after X-Men, 
    and then filming for Fantastic Four commences immediately afterwards.
