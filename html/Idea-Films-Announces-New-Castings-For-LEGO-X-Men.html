    “I know that the load sounds really heavy for someone who cowrote the script, produces, 
    co-edit, co-compose, films, and puts this whole thing together, but this is something I 
    want tot do so I can learn and understand more of what I can do and what I know I can 
    learn and have others have a chance to get them have the opportunity to bring their 
    talents together. The time crunch makes things a little more stressful, but I know it’s 
    something that’s doable.”

    It’s also reported that KiiD KAii will also be one of the other editors for the movie to 
    provide more of a cool stylistic approach to make it have multiple tones that will be adjusted 
    and balanced to where things can showcase each character and their abilities and stories.
